# epicor-editor README

This is an experimental Visual Studio Code Extension which allows you to Edit, Test and Debug Epicor Customizations right from VS Code
# THIS IS IN BETA, DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION, BACKUP YOUR CUSTOMIZATION BEFORE USING.


## Features

This is an extension which will allow you to Edit, Test and Debug Epicor Customizations right from VS Code. It can be quite handy specially for the code auto complete feature that VS Code Provides.

I would love some testers, and some feedback, open issues in GitHub. Thanks!

Here is a how to video of how it works, how to use it etc.

## Requirements

* You will need to have the [OmniSharp Extension] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) Installed to get this benefit to so install that first.

* If you want to be able to debug using DNSpy you will have to download and install [DNSpy] (https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/releases) and extract it into a folder of your choosing

* Please note you will have to download the helper library from the following links (based on your version of Epicor) and unzip it into your client folder

    [10.2.500.X](https://josecgomez.com/files/CustomizationHelper.10.2.500.X.zip?0.41.0)

    [10.2.400.X](https://josecgomez.com/files/CustomizationHelper.10.2.400.X.zip?0.41.0)

    [10.2.300.X](https://josecgomez.com/files/CustomizationHelper.10.2.300.X.zip?0.41.0)

    [10.2.200.X](https://josecgomez.com/files/CustomizationHelper.10.2.200.X.zip?0.41.0)

    [10.2.100.X](https://josecgomez.com/files/CustomizationHelper.10.2.100.X.zip?0.41.0)

    [10.1.600.X](https://josecgomez.com/files/CustomizationHelper.10.1.600.X.zip?0.41.0)

    [10.1.500.X](https://josecgomez.com/files/CustomizationHelper.10.1.500.X.zip?0.41.0)

* Whenever there is a new version of the VS Code extension, odds are that there is a new version of the helper library too. So download it again (every time the extension changes). I know its annoying I'm working on a more automated way    

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `epicor.clientfolder`: Should point to the folder where your Epicor client is installed
* `epicor.customizationfolder`: Should point to a folder where you'd like all the customization projects downloaded / created in
* `epicor.dnspylocationr`: The folder in which you installed DNSpy
